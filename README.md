# birdees-uniComp

## Project Description

The Katarzyna venue Birdees a club in Fortitude Valley Brisbane, was looking to run a competition between the University of Queensland and Queensland University of Technology to see which institution could have more people in the venue by a certain time.
The event was held in early 2019 and repeated in 2020 with the addition of Griffith University.

## Use Case

A count of the students in the venue needed to be displayed on the screen and a greeter at the door needed the ability to increment the counts.

## Technologies Used

Glitch.me was used to host a full stack node app. As the app was fairly simple the browser based hosting service was suitable and allowed quick changes when needed.
Express was used as the framework, and sockets were used to live update the screen.  Buttons for incrementing the scores were displayed and played a small scale animation upon incrementing.
Plain CSS was used to style the app.
